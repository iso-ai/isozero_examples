# Introduction to IsoZero

IsoZero is an innovative SDK designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot scenarios. By implementing a multi-step reasoning process, IsoZero enables LLMs to tackle complex tasks with improved accuracy and depth.

## Why IsoZero?

In the rapidly evolving field of AI and language models, zero-shot learning has become increasingly important. However, even advanced LLMs can struggle with complex tasks that require step-by-step reasoning or in-depth analysis. IsoZero addresses this challenge by:

1. Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
2. Guiding the LLM through a structured reasoning process
3. Incorporating document analysis for context-aware responses
4. Providing a flexible framework that works with multiple LLM backends

## Key Components

IsoZero consists of two main modules:

1. `reason_sim`: This module handles general reasoning tasks and document analysis. It's the core of IsoZero's multi-step reasoning process.

2. `math_sim`: Specialized for mathematical problem-solving, this module simulates the step-by-step approach a human might take when solving complex math problems.

## Use Cases

IsoZero is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- Complex question answering
- Document analysis and summarization
- Mathematical problem solving
- Logical reasoning tasks
- Multi-step decision making processes

By leveraging IsoZero, developers and researchers can push the boundaries of what's possible with zero-shot learning, opening up new possibilities in AI applications across various domains.

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into how to install and use IsoZero, explore its core concepts, and look at practical examples and use cases.
